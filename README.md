### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jason. I'm a Korean-Canadian Computer Engineering student at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). At UBC, in the very broad subject of Computer Engineering, I had the chance to study both Hardware(Computer Architecture, Robotics, Electronics, etc) and Software(Algorithms, Mobile Development, Web Development, etc). I'm currently a Software Developer Intern at IBM Skills Network Team working on a platform that educates millions of students and professionals on various subjects including Machine Learning, Data Science, Blockchain and more.
